# React-Blazor-Comparison

a repo for comparing React.js and Blazor

## Purpose

Many wonder where to go after learning JavaScript and React.js. This project is going to be used to show a comparison of two similar components built in React.js and Blazor so that those who know React.js can see a stepping off point to get into Blazor and visa versa.
