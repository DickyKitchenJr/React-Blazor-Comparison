# React-Blazor-Comparison

a repo for comparing React.js and Blazor

## Purpose

Many wonder where to go after learning JavaScript and React.js, or after learning Blazor. This project is going to be used to show a comparison of two similar components built in React.js and Blazor so that those who know React.js can see a stepping off point to get into Blazor and visa versa.

## Usage

- Clone this project, and then go into the README.md file of each individual project within for instructions on running it.

- Familiarize yourself with the project in the form you are most familiar (Blazor or React.js), then compare it to the other. You'll be surprised what you are able to understand with little to no explanation other than that.
